This project is a boilerplate for Angular. Actual version version ^18.0.1

# Components vs Pages

The _components_ folder is meant to be a container for all the Angular Component that do **not** have a route associated (as a bottombar, header, sidebar...). The _pages_ folder, instead, is meant to be a container for all the Angular Component that have a route associated (as a Login Page, Home Page...)
